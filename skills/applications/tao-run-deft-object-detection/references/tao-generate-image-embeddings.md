# DEFT OD — Embed Stage Overlay

Layers loop conventions on top of `tao-skill-bank:tao-generate-image-embeddings`. Read that skill's `SKILL.md` for the full field reference.

## When to invoke

Iteration stage 2, immediately after `gap_analysis`. Skipped only when `gap_analysis` produced zero weak images, in which case the loop stops rather than continuing.

## Input comes straight from gap analysis

`weak_images.parquet` already carries a `filepath` column, so it is fed to the embedder directly. No projection step is needed.

> The reference pipeline had an extra task here purely to rename `gt_image_path` → `filepath`, because its bespoke gap-analysis container emitted the former. The TAO DS `gap_analysis object_detection` action emits `filepath`, so that glue disappears.

## Encoder consistency is the whole ballgame

The embedding written here is compared against the **source-pool** embedding parquet during mining. Both must come from the same encoder — same `model` and same `model_path`. Mismatched encoders produce vectors that are not comparable, and the failure is silent: mining succeeds and returns confidently wrong neighbours.

Resolve `model` / `model_path` once in Pre-Flight (check 9) and reuse those exact values on every iteration from `state.config.embedding_model` / `state.config.embedding_model_path`. Never let one iteration pick a different encoder, and never let this stage fall back to a bare HuggingFace id at run time — Pre-Flight already decided between a local snapshot and a verified online id, and re-deciding mid-loop is how the two sides drift apart.

## Spec

Write per-iteration under `${RESULTS_DIR}/iter${N}/embeddings/image_embeddings.yaml`:

```yaml
input_parquet:  <absolute path to iter${N}/gaps/weak_images.parquet>
output_parquet: <absolute path to iter${N}/embeddings/weak_images_embeddings.parquet>
model:          <SigLIP|CLIP — from state.config.embedding_model>
model_path:     <from state.config.embedding_model_path>
model_config_path: ""      # only when model_path is a TAO .pth/.ckpt
batch_size:     64
```

## Invocation

```bash
docker run --rm --gpus all --ipc=host --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
  -v "$WORKSPACE:$WORKSPACE" -w "$WORKSPACE" \
  "$TAO_DS_IMAGE" \
  embedding image_embeddings -e "$EMBED_SPEC"
```

## Output

| Artifact | Path |
|---|---|
| `weak_images_embeddings.parquet` | `${RESULTS_DIR}/iter${N}/embeddings/weak_images_embeddings.parquet` |

Columns: `filepath`, `embedding` (list-like), plus every extra column carried through from `weak_images.parquet`.

The embedding column is named **`embedding`**, which is what `tmm unique_neighbor_matching` expects by default — no column override is needed anywhere in this loop.

> Worth knowing if you ever compare against the reference pipeline: its embedding image emitted `embedding` while three of its four miner variants hardcoded `image_embed`, so those combinations silently failed to find the vectors. The TAO DS pair agrees on `embedding` end to end.
