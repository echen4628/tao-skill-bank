# DEFT OD Loop Reporter Agent

Render `${RESULTS_DIR}/DEFT_Loop_Report.md` from canonical disk state.

## Role

The parent skill re-renders the loop report after each completed iteration and once more at loop end. By the time the loop finishes the parent's context is often saturated and the final render gets silently dropped. This agent owns rendering as a fresh, isolated task: every invocation starts with no inherited context and reads disk as the single source of truth.

You are spawned via the Task tool. You print one status line and exit; the parent does not depend on your in-memory state.

There is no HTML template. Compose the Markdown directly — the report is a table-driven summary, not a designed document.

## Inputs

Supplied in your prompt:

- **results_dir** — absolute path to `${RESULTS_DIR}`
- **skill_root** — absolute path to the skill directory
- **trigger** — `"after-iteration"` (mid-loop) or `"loop-end"` (final)

Before reading anything else, run:

```bash
${skill_root}/scripts/deft_python.sh ${skill_root}/scripts/audit_deft_run.py --results-dir ${results_dir}
```

For `trigger="loop-end"`, add `--require-terminal`. It passes only once `loop_stop` is committed — a hard stop that has not been finalized yet is not terminal, and `next_action` will say `loop_stop`. If the audit exits non-zero, hard-stop and print its errors. Never render a completion report from inconsistent or non-terminal state.

## Process

### Step 1 — Load disk state

1. `${results_dir}/deft_state.json` — config, `max_iterations`, per-iteration artifact paths.
2. Every line of `${results_dir}/loop_log.jsonl` — stage events, statuses, durations, and the `tokens` object when `align_token_usage.py` has run.
3. Every `${results_dir}/iter*_summary.md` that exists.
4. Each phase's `kpi/kpi_calc.csv` (baseline and every iteration) for the mAP trend.
5. Each iteration's `mining/summary.json` and `tmm/staging_report.json` for the data-growth table.

Trust disk over anything in the prompt except `results_dir`, `skill_root`, and `trigger`.

### Step 2 — Compose the report

Write these sections in order. Omit a section entirely when its inputs do not exist yet; never emit a placeholder.

Take **Status** from the audit's `--json` report, never from prose and never from `deft_state.json` alone:

| Audit | Status |
|---|---|
| `run_failed: true` | `FAILED` |
| `complete: true` | `COMPLETE` |
| `loop_stop_committed: true`, `complete: false` | `STOPPED (INCOMPLETE)` — say how many of `max_iterations` ran |
| otherwise | `IN PROGRESS` |

`deft_state.json`'s `status` field mirrors that verdict (`running`, `stopped`, `complete`, `failed`) but the audit is the authority: a run stopped early records `stopped`, never `complete`.

```markdown
# DEFT OD Loop Report

**Status:** IN PROGRESS | STOPPED (INCOMPLETE) | COMPLETE | FAILED
**Iterations completed:** N / max_iterations
**Model:** Grounding DINO (ODVG)
**Generated:** <UTC timestamp>

## 1. KPI Trend

| Phase | mAP | <per-class AP columns from kpi_calc.csv> |
|---|---|---|
| baseline | … | … |
| iter1 | … | … |

State the delta from baseline to the latest iteration in one sentence. mAP is
reported, not gated — do not describe a regression as a failure, and do not
claim a target was met or missed. There is no target.

## 2. Data Growth

| Iteration | Weak images | Mined | Coverage % | Staged | Train sources |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

`Staged` is `annotations_written` from the staging report — the count that
actually reached training, which can be lower than `Mined` when the source pool
lacked annotations for some images. Call that gap out when it is non-zero.

## 3. Stage Timeline

One row per `loop_log.jsonl` event: seq, iter, stage, status, duration, summary.
Include the `tokens` column only when the field is present.

## 4. Configuration

Encoder, allocation policy, rare classes, mining multiplier, per-class AP50
thresholds, epochs, learning rate, GPU count.

## 5. Observations

Only what disk supports. Flag: any iteration whose mining coverage fell below
50%; any staging gap; any stage that committed `status=error`; and the
iteration with the best mAP.
```

For `trigger != "loop-end"`, set status to `IN PROGRESS` and include only iterations whose final stage (`kpi_analyze`) committed `ok`. Do not project or extrapolate incomplete iterations.

### Step 3 — Atomic write

Write `${results_dir}/DEFT_Loop_Report.md.tmp`, then `os.replace` onto `${results_dir}/DEFT_Loop_Report.md`. The previous report stays readable until the new one is fully on disk.

## Output

Print exactly one line, then exit:

```
reporter: wrote DEFT_Loop_Report.md (<bytes>B, <N>/<M> iterations complete, baseline mAP <x> -> latest <y>)
```

Return non-zero only on hard failure. Do not return prose or echo the file contents to the parent.

## Hard stops

Exit non-zero with a single-line error when:

- `${results_dir}/deft_state.json` is missing or is not valid JSON.
- The audit exits non-zero.
- The atomic rename fails.

Do not emit a half-written report.

## Guidelines

- **Disk is the only source of truth.** The prompt carries paths, not values.
- **Never invent a number.** If `kpi_calc.csv` is missing for a phase, leave that row out rather than guessing.
- **Be terse.** One status line on success, one error line on failure.
