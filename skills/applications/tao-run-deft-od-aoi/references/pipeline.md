# DEFT OD AOI pipeline

Read this for stage order and completion gates. Read only the stage-specific
reference and leaf skill needed for the current step.

## 0. Prepare sources and freeze the contract

If the customer supplied source COCO files instead of an existing four-role
handoff, author `dataset_sources.json`, run `prepare_deft_od_aoi_sources.py
--check-only`, then materialize it in the pinned Data Services image. The
preparer writes canonical per-source COCO shards, delegates each role merge to
`annotations merge`, and validates the merged outputs before publishing the
new normalized directory. Use the emitted `sources.json` as the policy's
`sources` mapping.

Copy and complete `assets/default_policy.yaml`, then run
`init_deft_od_aoi.py` into a new result directory. Gate on
`deft_od_aoi_policy.yaml`, `input_contract.json`, and `deft_state.json`.

When a synthesis route lacks task weights, run
`resolve_deft_od_aoi_synthesis.py` and complete every emitted fine-tuning
request before building the candidate cache.

## 1. Build candidate embeddings

Run `prepare_deft_od_aoi_retrieval.py candidates`. Submit the emitted real
and clean embedding specs through `tao-generate-image-embeddings`. The
completed outputs are immutable and reused by every iteration. Commit the
`candidate_cache` stage.

## 2. Baseline measurement and gaps

Run `prepare_deft_od_aoi_measurement.py --baseline` with the frozen base
checkpoint. In default `cold_start` mode, it emits empty KPI prediction files
and cardinality-matched empty test prediction evidence, but no inference specs,
so every KPI ground-truth box begins as an FN while the KPI/test completion
contract remains intact. In explicit `checkpoint` mode, submit its KPI and
report-only test inference specs using a binary-compatible checkpoint. Then
submit the emitted loose and strict gap specs via `tao-analyze-gaps-od-map`.
Commit baseline measurement and gap artifacts.

## 3. Per-iteration retrieval

Run `prepare_deft_od_aoi_retrieval.py queries` with the previous strict and
loose gap parquets and the prior cumulative COCO when one exists. Submit each
enabled query-embedding action, then each enabled `tao-mine-od-images` action.
Empty and exhausted roles require no job. Commit `iteration_retrieval` with
each queried role's query parquet and exclusion parquet; the latter preserves
the exact history/configured exclusion audit even when it is empty.

## 4. Admit real and clean data

Run `admit_deft_od_aoi_coco.py`. For iteration 2 and later, pass the prior
iteration's cumulative `train.json`. Gate on the new binary COCO,
`admitted_sources.parquet`, and `admission_report.json`. Commit
`iteration_admission`.

## 5. Optional synthesis

Run `prepare_deft_od_aoi_synthesis.py` against strict FN gaps. Pass the
filtering YAML through `tao-prepare-anomalygennext-inputs`, complete its
embedding and AMP actions, then invoke `tao-generate-od-defects`.

Re-run admission with the generated binary COCO and image root. Commit
`iteration_synthesis`. Never synthesize from a box without its exact mask.

## 6. Train and select

Run `prepare_deft_od_aoi_training.py`. Iterations 1–2 emit direct
`train.yaml`. Later iterations may emit three probe specs. Submit probes,
then run `select_deft_od_aoi_training.py probes` to materialize the selected
main spec. Submit main training from the frozen base checkpoint.

Run `select_deft_od_aoi_training.py checkpoint` over all status phases. If it
emits `extension.yaml`, submit that same-iteration resume once and reselect
with `--extension-applied`. Commit `iteration_training`.

## 7. Measure, gap, and advance

Prepare measurement with the KPI-best selected checkpoint, then repeat KPI/test
inference and dual gap analysis. Commit measurement and gaps. Start the next
iteration only from the committed state.

After every application-owned stage, use `commit_deft_od_aoi_stage.py` with
the stage evidence it names: retrieval manifest and enabled-role parquets,
admission report, generation report when synthesis runs, checkpoint-selection
report, measurement manifest, and both gap reports and gap parquets. The
committer validates their identities and counts before advancing. The state is
durable history; native platform status remains authoritative while work is live.
