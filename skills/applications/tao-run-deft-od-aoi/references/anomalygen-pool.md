# AnomalyGenNext synthesis contract

Read this only when synthesis is enabled.

## Reference pool

`synthesis.pool_dataset_root` points to the normalized pool consumed by
`tao-prepare-anomalygennext-inputs`:

```text
POOL/
  TEXTURE/
    clean_image/*
    mask/DEFECT/*
```

The frozen `defect_spec.jsonl` must define every selected
`TEXTURE+DEFECT`. Text-routed definitions require
`roi_prompt_defect_location`. KPI FNs provide explicit
`dataset_id`, `texture_id`, `defect_class`, and `fn_mask_source`.
A box is not a mask, and this application never invents masks or prompts.

## Existing task weights

Each key in `synthesis.routes` matches a KPI `dataset_id` and provides:

```yaml
routes:
  line_a:
    checkpoint: /models/line_a/adapter.pt
    recipe: /models/line_a/canonical_recipe.yaml
    base_checkpoint: /models/Cosmos3-Nano
    vae_path: /models/Wan2.2_VAE.pth
```

All four inputs must exist before iteration preparation. The recipe must declare
the types requested from that route. `base_checkpoint` is the distributed DCP
generation directory, not the Hugging Face Cosmos payload used by AMP;
`vae_path` is the Wan2.2 VAE that the generation platform must also expose at
the generator's canonical container path.

## Missing task weights

A route may instead carry a one-time fine-tuning plan:

```yaml
routes:
  line_a:
    finetune:
      dataset_root: /data/line_a/anomalygen
      validation_testcase: /data/line_a/validation.jsonl
      base_checkpoint: /models/Cosmos3-Nano
      vae_path: /models/Wan2.2_VAE.pth
      nn_backbone: /models/dinov2-large
      result_handoff: /results/line_a/training_handoff.json
      recipe_template: /data/line_a/recipe.yaml   # optional
      defect_spec: /data/line_a/defect_spec.jsonl # optional override
```

Run `resolve_deft_od_aoi_synthesis.py` before the candidate cache. A missing
handoff produces `finetune_requests.json`. Execute each request through
`tao-finetune-anomalygennext` once, then resolve again into a new directory.

Accept a completed handoff only when dataset identity matches, anomaly types
are nonempty, and recipe/checkpoint hashes verify. Freeze the emitted
`resolved_synthesis_policy.yaml` for the run. Never start or resume
AnomalyGenNext training inside an iteration.

## Iteration handoff

`prepare_deft_od_aoi_synthesis.py` converts exact strict FN/annotation matches
to a filtering YAML for `tao-prepare-anomalygennext-inputs`. The resulting
generation plan is passed to `tao-generate-od-defects`. Only its validated
binary COCO enters admission, under the cumulative synthetic fraction cap. The
resolver preserves each route's generation base and VAE paths through the
filtering config into that finalized generation plan.
