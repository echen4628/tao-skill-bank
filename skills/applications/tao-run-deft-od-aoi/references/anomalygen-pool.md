# AnomalyGenNext synthesis contract

Read this only when synthesis is enabled.

## Reference pool

`synthesis.pool_dataset_root` points to the normalized pool consumed by
`tao-prepare-anomalygennext-inputs`:

```text
POOL/
  TEXTURE/
    clean_image/*
    mask/DEFECT/*
```

An enabled synthesis policy must start with at least one supported image under
some `TEXTURE/clean_image` directory; initialization rejects a globally empty
reference pool. Individual texture pools may still be absent or empty because
their routed FNs are handled independently during iteration preparation.

The frozen `defect_spec.jsonl` must define every selected
`TEXTURE+DEFECT`. Text-routed definitions require
`roi_prompt_defect_location`. Every KPI FN provides `dataset_id` so the
application can decide whether it is routed for synthesis. FNs whose dataset
ID is not in `synthesis.routes` remain in the normal real-data path and are
counted in the synthesis request report. A missing or empty `dataset_id` is
malformed metadata, not an opt-out mechanism. Routed FNs must also provide
explicit `texture_id`, `defect_class`, and `fn_mask_source`. A box is not a
mask, and this application never invents masks or prompts.

## Existing task weights

Each key in `synthesis.routes` matches a KPI `dataset_id` and provides:

```yaml
routes:
  line_a:
    checkpoint: /models/line_a/adapter.pt
    recipe: /models/line_a/canonical_recipe.yaml
```

Both files must exist before iteration preparation. The recipe must declare the
types requested from that route.

## Missing task weights

A route may instead carry a one-time fine-tuning plan:

```yaml
routes:
  line_a:
    finetune:
      dataset_root: /data/line_a/anomalygen
      validation_testcase: /data/line_a/validation.jsonl
      base_checkpoint: /models/Cosmos3-Nano
      vae_path: /models/Wan2.2_VAE.pth
      checkpoint_root: /models/anomalygen-checkpoints
      result_handoff: /results/line_a/training_handoff.json
      recipe_template: /data/line_a/recipe.yaml   # optional
      defect_spec: /data/line_a/defect_spec.jsonl # optional override
```

`checkpoint_root` must contain the required Qwen tokenizer model assets under
`hf/` and `facebook/dinov2-large/` with its Transformers config and weights.
The training action mounts this entire directory over the image's
`/workspace/paidf-anomalygen/checkpoints`; mounting only DINOv2 is insufficient.
Reuse that same complete root for `tao-prepare-anomalygennext-inputs.run_amp`
and `tao-generate-od-defects.generate`. Both actions require the canonical
mount rather than independent SAM2 or Hugging Face cache inputs, and each
validates its action-specific assets before GPU work.

Run `resolve_deft_od_aoi_synthesis.py` before the candidate cache. A missing
handoff produces `finetune_requests.json`. Execute each request through
`tao-finetune-anomalygennext` once, then resolve again into a new directory.

Accept a completed handoff only when dataset identity matches, anomaly types
are nonempty, and recipe/checkpoint hashes verify. Freeze the emitted
`resolved_synthesis_policy.yaml` for the run. Never start or resume
AnomalyGenNext training inside an iteration.

## Iteration handoff

`prepare_deft_od_aoi_synthesis.py` converts exact strict FN/annotation matches
to a filtering YAML for `tao-prepare-anomalygennext-inputs`. The resulting
generation plan is passed to `tao-generate-od-defects`. Only its validated
logical `binary_coco` output enters admission, under the cumulative synthetic
fraction cap. Its exact relative path comes from the authoritative action
contract; the native fine-grained COCO remains separately available as
`native_coco`.
Admission removes undersized, extreme-aspect, and full-frame boxes, then
allocates available capacity proportionally across source `dataset_id` values
with deterministic selection.

If there are no routed FNs, `synthesis_request.json` is a typed `SKIPPED`
contract whose evidence lists the observed dataset IDs, configured route keys,
total skipped count, per-dataset skipped counts, and a human-readable summary.
If every routed FN fails mask eligibility, the preparation leaf emits a typed
`SKIPPED` `input_contract.json` with per-FN reasons. Either contract completes
the optional synthesis stage without AMP, generation, or synthetic re-admission.

Clean reference images are a synthesis-only input, distinct from the DEFT clean
retrieval role. A missing or empty reference directory marks only its routed FNs
with `no_clean_reference_images`; other eligible types and real-data mining
continue. When all routed FNs have that reason, the input contract is typed
`SKIPPED` with preparation-level reason `no_eligible_false_negatives`, carries
the specific per-FN reason and warning evidence, and emits no embedding or AMP
work.
