# Normalized source handoff

Use this reference to convert one or more customer COCO datasets into the four
roles accepted by DEFT OD AOI. The application provides a generic manifest
preparer; it does not contain dataset-name-specific parsers.

## Source manifest

Create `dataset_sources.json` with one or more COCO inputs per role:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "inputs": {
    "benchmark": [{"coco": "/data/benchmark.json",
                   "images_dir": "/data/benchmark/images"}],
    "test": [{"coco": "/data/test.json", "images_dir": "/data/test/images"}],
    "mining": [{"coco": ["/data/train.json", "/data/mine.json"],
                "images_dir": "/data/images"}],
    "clean": [{"coco": "/data/clean.json", "images_dir": "/data/clean/images"}]
  }
}
```

Paths may be absolute or relative to the manifest. `coco` accepts one path or
a list. Benchmark and test inputs may contain boxed and boxless images. The
preparer maps user-facing `benchmark` to the downstream internal `kpi` role.
`mining` and `clean` may be empty arrays when that retrieval producer is not
available. Every nonempty mining image must have a box, while every explicit
nonempty clean COCO must have zero annotations. Empty roles are materialized as
canonical zero-image COCO documents and reported through typed capability and
warning evidence; they do not disable the other role or optional synthesis.
The preparer maps all input categories to the one `defect` category and rejects
cross-role image overlap.

Validate without writing output, then materialize into a new directory:

```bash
scripts/prepare_deft_od_aoi_sources.py \
  --manifest /data/dataset_sources.json --check-only

scripts/prepare_deft_od_aoi_sources.py \
  --manifest /data/dataset_sources.json \
  --output-dir /new/results/normalized --link-mode symlink
```

Use `--link-mode copy` when the normalized directory must own portable image
copies. `--check-only` needs no container; materialization runs in the pinned
TAO Data Services image. It retains canonical per-source files under
`merge_inputs/`, invokes the existing `annotations merge` action once per role,
and post-validates each merged COCO. Existing output directories are never
overwritten. The output includes the frozen input manifest, merge evidence,
normalized COCO files and image views, a provenance report, and `sources.json`
ready for initialization or the SLURM acceptance driver.

## Handoff shape

Each role supplies an image directory and COCO file:

```yaml
sources:
  kpi:   {images: /data/kpi/images,   coco: /data/kpi.json}
  test:  {images: /data/test/images,  coco: /data/test.json}
  real:  {images: /data/real/images,  coco: /data/real.json}
  clean: {images: /data/clean/images, coco: /data/clean.json}
```

Preserve a stable absolute `source_path` on each image when the normalized
view does not physically own the source file. The application hashes the COCO
contracts and resolves every referenced image during initialization.

## Normalization rules

- Map all foreground categories to one category named `defect`.
- Keep boxless images only in explicitly verified clean or held-out roles.
- Keep clean images as COCO image rows with zero annotations.
- Preserve an intentionally empty real or clean role as a zero-image canonical
  COCO and mark only that retrieval capability unavailable.
- Never place one resolved image identity in more than one role.
- Preserve provenance metadata needed for audit.
- For synthesis, preserve exact `dataset_id`, `texture_id`, `defect_class`,
  and pixel-mask paths on eligible benchmark records.
- Do not infer AnomalyGenNext types from filenames at this boundary.

Validate the resulting handoff with `init_deft_od_aoi.py`; its output policy is
the immutable downstream contract. Raw-image discovery, filename-based routing,
and dataset-specific metadata inference remain explicit adapters before this
generic COCO boundary.
