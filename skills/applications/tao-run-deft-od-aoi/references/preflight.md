# Preflight and launch review

Complete this gate before creating a job record or submitting any action.

## Contract review

- Select an installed supported platform and run its preflight.
- Confirm the four normalized COCO roles and their resolved image roots.
- Confirm the detector backend, compatible trainable base checkpoint, and maximum iterations.
- Confirm KPI is used for selection and test is report-only.
- Resolve the selected RT-DETR or YOLO detector, Data Services, SigLIP embedding, mining, and optional
  AnomalyGenNext images from their owning skills.
- For YOLO, record the reviewed license posture and keep the integration local;
  on edge-AI, gate training on enabled OneLogger callbacks and login presence.
- Confirm GPU shape, storage mappings, runtime estimate, and durable
  `results_dir`.
- Confirm synthesis is disabled or has exact pixel masks, a defect
  specification, reference pool, Cosmos3-Nano assets, and either existing task
  weights or complete one-time fine-tuning routes.

Do not create output directories that actions require to be absent. Existing
DEFT results are resumed only through their committed
`deft_state.json`; never reinitialize them.

## Read-only validation

Before launch:

1. Validate all local source and checkpoint paths.
2. Run `init_deft_od_aoi.py` only after the approved policy has been written
   to a new location.
3. Inspect every emitted YAML as nested dictionaries; reject dotted keys at the
   container boundary.
4. Verify the class map is `background` followed by `defect`.
5. Confirm no KPI or test image identity appears in training sources.
6. Confirm each planned action's required predecessor artifact exists and its
   owning job reached `COMPLETE`.
7. For synthesis, resolve every route before iteration 0 and verify handoff
   hashes for newly trained adapters.

## Launch

Invoke `tao-launch-workflow`, present the consolidated launch review, obtain
confirmation, create the job record, then use the selected platform's
`submit/status/logs/cancel` verbs. Poll the backend for live state. A
scheduler success does not override a missing or invalid completion artifact.

Platform-specific staging, cache, filesystem, scheduler, and recovery policy
belongs to the selected platform skill; it is intentionally not duplicated
here.
