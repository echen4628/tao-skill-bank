# Inputs and packaged defaults

Read this during intake. Preserve explicit user values. Apply defaults only to
omitted values, show their source in the launch review, and freeze the approved
policy once.

## Required inputs

- An installed supported execution platform; never choose among peers silently.
- `max_iterations`.
- A baseline mode. `auto` resolves to `cold_start_all_kpi_gt` for true-fresh
  RT-DETR and `checkpoint_inference` otherwise.
- Four normalized roles described in `data-contract.md`.
- One detector backend (`rtdetr` or `yolo`) and one
  compatible trainable base checkpoint. Every iteration starts from this same
  checkpoint; a prior iteration checkpoint is never the next initializer.
- Separate KPI and test roles.
- An explicit synthesis decision.

When synthesis is enabled, require a normalized reference pool,
`defect_spec.jsonl`, Cosmos3-Nano assets, and either an existing
checkpoint/recipe pair or a complete one-time fine-tuning block for every KPI
`dataset_id`. Read `anomalygen-pool.md`.

## Packaged algorithm values

The authoritative values live in `assets/default_policy.yaml`. Important
defaults are:

- inference confidence `0.001`;
- loose/strict gap confidence `0.3` / `0.8`;
- match IoU `0.5`;
- background-like FP boundary below `0.05`;
- SigLIP `google/siglip-base-patch16-224`;
- defect context scale `1.5`;
- clean grids `[1, 2]`;
- initial minimum similarity `-1.0`;
- real mining factor range `1..6`;
- clean dose `2` per routed FP and cumulative cap `1.0` per admitted real;
- RT-DETR train shape of four GPUs, batch size eight, base LR `1e-4`, and
  backbone LR `1e-5`;
- 36 epochs for iterations 1–2;
- three ten-epoch probes from configurable `training.probe_start_iteration`
  (default 3);
- adaptive main budget of 24–48 epochs;
- one 12-epoch late-best extension;
- YOLO26X comparison profile: 100 epochs, patience 20, image size 640,
  batch/nbs 32, four devices, and four data workers;
- synthesis disabled;
- synthetic cumulative cap `0.25` relative to admitted real defects.

A value frozen in the policy is no longer a default. Changing it starts a new
contract rather than silently mutating an existing run.

The probe, adaptive-budget, late-extension, and soup defaults apply only to
RT-DETR. The initial YOLO backend intentionally disables those unvalidated
stages and performs separate KPI and report-only test evaluations.
