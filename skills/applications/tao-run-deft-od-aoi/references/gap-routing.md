# Gap matching and retrieval routing

Read this when preparing KPI gap jobs or interpreting retrieval requests.

## Dual gap passes

Run `tao-analyze-gaps-od-map` action `object_detection` twice over the same
KPI ground truth and predictions:

| Pass | Confidence | Consumed rows | Route |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Loose | 0.3 | false positives | near miss → real; background-like → clean |
| Strict | 0.8 | false negatives | real and optional synthesis |

Both passes use same-class one-to-one matching at IoU 0.5. An unmatched loose
prediction below IoU 0.05 is background-like. From 0.05 inclusive to 0.5
exclusive it is a near miss. A strict FN may represent a missed object or an
object covered only by a lower-confidence prediction.

The inference threshold remains 0.001 so gap analysis, rather than inference,
owns the loose and strict operating points.

## SigLIP retrieval

Build the candidate cache once:

- each real annotation produces a 1.5× contextual crop;
- each verified-clean image produces the whole image and a 2×2 grid;
- both roles use the same frozen SigLIP encoder.

For each iteration, crop strict FNs and near-miss FPs as real queries, and
background-like loose FPs as clean queries. Embed queries with the identical
encoder. Invoke `tao-mine-od-images` using the emitted role-specific specs.
Context crops smaller than 8 pixels on either edge are expanded around the
requested defect center within image bounds. Only source images narrower than
8 pixels require zero padding; ordinary crop dimensions remain unchanged.

Retrieval is global within the real or clean role. Provenance metadata does not
partition the index. Empty query roles emit no action. Admission recomputes
maximum cosine similarity from the frozen embeddings, applies the frozen
minimum, deduplicates parent images, and enforces cumulative caps.

The initial `-1.0` similarity threshold is an explicit calibration policy,
not evidence that all candidates are equally useful. Review retrieval outputs
before freezing a stricter value for a later run.
