## Description: <br>
Runs the embed-then-mine workflow for object detection iterations using unique neighbor matching — embeds a gap parquet of weak OD images, embeds a source pool, and mines bijectively-assigned source images via `tmm unique_neighbors` for downstream OD training augmentation. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 <br>

## Use Case: <br>
Developers and engineers expanding real-image augmentation queues for object detection training iterations by mining uniquely-assigned source images from a pool against gap-analysis target parquets. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

Risk: Source pool smaller than target set leaves some targets unassigned with no fallback. <br>
Mitigation: Check `mining_summary.txt` for unassigned target count and expand the source pool or switch to `nearest_neighbors` if needed. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`claude-code`) <br>
- Codex (`codex`) <br>

## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
Evaluated against 1 evaluation task in the NVSkills-Eval external profile (astra-sandbox environment). <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks whether skill-assisted execution avoids unsafe behavior such as secret leakage, destructive commands, or unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks whether the agent follows the expected workflow and produces the correct final output. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the agent loads the skill when relevant and avoids using it when irrelevant. <br>
- Effectiveness: Checks whether the agent performs measurably better with the skill than without it. <br>
- Efficiency: Checks whether the agent uses fewer tokens and avoids redundant work. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Verifies that the agent loaded the expected skill and workflow. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Checks routing quality, decoy avoidance, and redundant tool usage. <br>
- `accuracy`: Grades final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Checks whether the overall user task completed successfully. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Verifies expected behavior steps, including safety expectations. <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Compares token usage with and without the skill. <br>
