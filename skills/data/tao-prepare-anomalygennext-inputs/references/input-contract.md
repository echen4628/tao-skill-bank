# Normalized AnomalyGenNext preparation contract

The preparation leaf accepts normalized identity instead of legacy path rules.
The producer must freeze `dataset_id`, `texture_id`, `defect_class`,
`anomaly_type`, and `fn_mask_source` on every gap row before launch.

`bbox` is `[x1, y1, x2, y2]` in source-image pixels. `fn_mask_source` must be a
same-size pixel mask; a detector box is not a replacement. `split` is an opaque
selection bucket such as `kpi` or `test`.

Preparation evaluates each selected FN independently. A source FN mask must be
readable, nonempty, non-full, have a tight extent smaller than the full frame,
match the source-image dimensions, and contain pixels inside its FN box. Donor
masks must satisfy the same mask-content gates; deterministic selection falls
through to later same-type donors when an earlier donor is invalid. The source
pool is never changed.

The clean-reference directory for each normalized texture must contain at least
one supported image. Missing and empty directories produce the stable per-FN
reason `no_clean_reference_images`. Those FNs are absent from query, embedding,
mask, and AMP inputs; eligible FNs for other types continue independently.

The YAML `datasets` mapping assigns each `dataset_id` an existing checkpoint
and recipe. This action verifies that both files exist and that the recipe's
`anomaly_types` contains the normalized `TEXTURE+TYPE`. A later synthesis
integration may resolve those two paths from a completed fine-tuning handoff,
but they must be concrete before invoking this leaf.

Selection supports:

- `all_eligible`: every eligible FN in the listed datasets.
- `per_dataset`: the first deterministic `per_dataset` rows from the named
  `split` for each listed dataset.

The same frozen encoder identity is written to both embedding specs. The next
action must use those specs unchanged so clean and FN vectors remain comparable.
`input_contract.json` records eligible IDs, skipped IDs, and skip reasons. An
all-ineligible selection is a typed `SKIPPED` result and emits no embedding or
AMP inputs with top-level reason `no_eligible_false_negatives`. Detailed
`skip_counts`, per-FN reason `no_clean_reference_images`, and warning evidence
record clean-reference failures without creating a separate stage-level reason.

`run_amp` joins the unique source-image embedding back to every box-level FN,
ranks distinct clean image paths within the normalized texture and anomaly-type
pool, and creates two AMP requests for every eligible pair. When the embedding
action emits several crop vectors for one clean image, its maximum crop
similarity is the image-level score; crop rows never occupy separate neighbor
ranks. It rejects missing, non-finite, zero-norm, or width-mismatched
embeddings. AMP itself remains owned by the container-native
`anomalygen.scripts.auto_mask_placement.roi_place` entry point.

`finalize_inputs` retains the configured number of successful neighbors per FN.
Both aligned mask branches must match the clean image and cover neither zero nor
all pixels. It copies accepted masks under the prepared root and hashes every
generation contract artifact, without changing the source training pool.
